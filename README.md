# Tripify

Tripify is an AI-powered Flutter application designed by **Lim Weng Ni** and **Tan Wei Siang** to simplify travel planning through a content-based recommendation system and an intelligent travel assistant. Developed using Flutter and Dart, with Python AI integration via Ollama, the app generates personalized itineraries based on user preferences such as destination and travel dates. Users can manage their profiles, create and share posts, store documents, and collaborate with friends on trip planning. The AI assistant offers general travel tips and personalized advice, even allowing users to upload itineraries for further guidance. The app streamlines the selection of destinations, activities, accommodations, and transportation, improving planning efficiency. Testing focused on the relevance of recommendations, UI responsiveness, and AI interaction quality. Future improvements include expanding the travel recommendation database and adding offline access features for greater convenience.
